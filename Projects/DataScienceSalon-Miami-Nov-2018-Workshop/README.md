# Design and programming of conversational agents workshop
### Data Science Salon, Miami, November 6-7, 2018

## Introduction

This project has presentation, documents, code and other support materials 
for the workshop "Design and programming of conversational agents" scheduled
for the 
[Data Science Salon](https://datascience.salon)
conference 
[APPLYING AI AND MACHINE LEARNING TO FINANCE AND TECHNOLOGY, MIAMI, NOVEMBER 6-7 2018](https://datascience.salon/miami11-18/)
.

make a more informed decision (for attending or not.)***
 
### Mission statement

**Primary:** To introduce, teach, and illustrate the making of conversational agents 
using 
[context free grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar)
and 
[finite state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)
.

**Secondary:** To speed up the coming of the next 
[AI winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter)
.

## Plan

1. Introduction to (a particular style of) conversational agents making. (*25 min.*)

   - Big picture.
  
   - Some theory and examples.
   
   - Vote with your face.
  
2. Selection of a conversational agent to make. (*10 min.*)

   - "Fake news maker"
   
     - *Bombastic and "free form".*
  
   - "Will they kill me?"
   
     - *There is enough data for making it.*
  
   - "Personal banking data obfuscation"
   
     - *Should be interesting to data analysts.*
   
   - "Regression workflows"
   
      - *Simple enough and good for overview learning.*
   
   - "Neural networks construction and training"
   
     - *May be too complicated... But meshes well with other talks at the conference.* 
   
3. Brainstorming on the design. (*20-30 min.*)

4. Break ? (*10 min.*)

5. Making grammars. (*45 min.*)

6. Wrap up / Putting it all together. (*15 min.*) 
 
   - What is next?
   
   - Why keep learning about this?


## Didactic examples

Here are links to the projects that have the examples to be discussed in the first part of the workshop.

- Fully worked example: 
["Phone Dialing Dialogs Agent"]()
.

- 90% design complete example:
["Glukoza"]()
.

## Code examples guide

### Mission statement

The code examples are made with the hope that they illustrate the making of grammars
in different languages and how mature that methodology is.
