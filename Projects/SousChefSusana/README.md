# Sous-chef Susana

This project has documents and diagrams for design and implementation
of a conversational agent named “Sous-chef-Susana” aimed at facilitating 
of food preparation (cooking) activities. (See [Wk1].) 

**Remark:** More precisely, food preparation support and analysis.

Project's goal is to make a general component design and a more or less complete grammar
for the envisioned dialogs.

Here is a mind-map that outlines of the scope of the project:

## Similarities with Glukoza
 
Susana is very similar to the conversational agent 
[Glukoza](../Glukoza)
in both component design and grammar design and elements.
