* Introduction
- In this document we discuss different alternatives for
  (human) multi-language support with the Raku packages:
  - [ ] EpidemiologyModelingWorkflows
  - [ ] ClassificationWorkflows
  - [ ] NeuralNetworkWorflows
  - [ ] DataTransformationsWorkflow
  - [ ] LatentSemanticAnalysisWorkflows
  - [ ] QuantileRegressionWorkflows
  - [ ] RecommenderWorkflows
** Problem formulation
- From a given Raku parser-interpreter package based on English derive
  parser-interpreter package that handles commands in Chinese.
* Preliminary steps
** TODO Select a workflows package
** Anton Grammar clean-up
** Jia Unit tests
** Anton Additional organization documentation
* Concrete steps
** Given
- A well known and understood system of workflows implemented in a parser-interpreter package based on English.
  - Denote with *PKG-EN*.
- A human language.
  - Denote with *LANG*.
** Goal 
- To make a parser-interpreter package based on LANG.
  - Denote with *PKG-LANG".
** Assumptions
- There is at least one software monad that provides actual computations for the code generated by *PKG-EN*.
- The sentences of LANG can be parsed with Raku grammars in EBNF.
** Steps
1. Copy the English Raku package.
2. Re-write the English parsing unit tests into unit tests for LANG.
3. Write at least a dozen commands with LANG.
4. Verify that the commands in the file "Grammar.pm6" would work for commands with LANG.
5. Re-write main commands that given to the rule TOP.
   - This includes re-writing and adding new terminals and phrases.
6. Run unit tests.
7. If insufficient number of unit test pass goto 5.
8. Document main use cases using LANG.
